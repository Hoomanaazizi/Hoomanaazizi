Hi! I'm Hooman Azizi-Asl, a data science student in my 5th week. I'm passionate about exploring the world of data and its potential to solve problems. 
I'm particularly interested in learning data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to unlock insights from data.  

I share some of my projects during my nootcamp in here:

Project 1: Holiday Cost Calculator

Description: This Python program calculates the total cost of a holiday trip, including hotel stay, car rental, and flight costs.
Features:
Calculates hotel cost based on the number of nights and user-provided price per night.
Calculates car rental cost based on the number of rental days and user-provided daily rental price.
Retrieves flight costs from a pre-defined dictionary based on the user's chosen destination (currently supports Tokyo, Bangkok, and Seoul).
Provides a user-friendly interface for input and displays the total holiday cost.

Project 2: Email Simulator using OOP

Description: This program simulates an email inbox using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.
Features:
Creates Email objects with attributes like sender email, subject line, content, and a read status flag.
Offers functionalities to populate the inbox with sample emails, list emails with subject lines, read a specific email, and mark emails as read.
Implements basic error handling for user input.
