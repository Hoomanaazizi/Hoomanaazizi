# ### --- OOP Email Simulator --- ###

# # --- Email Class --- #
# # Create the class, constructor and methods to create a new Email object.

#     # Declare the class variable, with default value, for emails. 
 
#     # Initialise the instance variables for emails.

#     # Create the method to change 'has_been_read' emails from False to True.

# # --- Lists --- #
# # Initialise an empty list to store the email objects.

# # --- Functions --- #
# # Build out the required functions for your program.

# def populate_inbox():
    
#     # Create 3 sample emails and add it to the Inbox list. 

# def list_emails():
    
#     # Create a function which prints the emailâ€™s subject_line, along with a corresponding number.

# def read_email(index):

#     # Create a function which displays a selected email. 
#     # Once displayed, call the class method to set its 'has_been_read' variable to True.

# # --- Email Program --- #

# # Call the function to populate the Inbox for further use in your program.

# # Fill in the logic for the various menu operations.
